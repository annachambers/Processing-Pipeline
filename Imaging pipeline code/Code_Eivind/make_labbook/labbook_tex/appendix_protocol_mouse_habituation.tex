\subsection{Purpose}
Habituate mice to being handled, head-fixed and passively rotated while
head-fixed. It can be very stressful for mice to be picked up, and especially to
be head-fixed. We want to minimize this stress-factor, both to treat the animal
well, but also to run experiments in conditions where the mice are observing
what is going on around them.

\subsection{General Information}
Always wear gloves and follow Animal Facilities Protocols when working with mice.

\subsection{Procedure}
Handling and habituation is started 7 days prior to imaging/screening.

\underline{Day 1.} Place hand in cage, and let the mice sniff and explore it.
Pick them up and hold them in the hand for some seconds. Afterwards, keep them in hand till they calm down.
\underline{Day 2.}
